## General Info
The aim of this project is to create a tool that helps an user to convert a .csv file into a randomized "INSERTS.sql" archive,
which will help the user quickly add information to a previously created Oracle SQL Developer database based on an exercise.

## Programming Language Used
C#

## Usage

The first step is to localize the .csv file that comes with the download of this repository, it will be on "./sql-random-insert-generator/data/datos.csv" folder.

You will need to copy the absolute path of this location and paste it on the code "path" variable.

Finally, when you run the code it will create an "INSERTS.sql" looking like this:

Which will work to add new info into the sql.

## Extra
If you want to add more information to the .csv keep in mind the separation of each column, for example, if you want to add a new address you
will need to leave department,fName,lName and position empty such as:

(;;;;"WallStreet lower")
